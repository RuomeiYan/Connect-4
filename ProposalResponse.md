## Tentative Rating
Average to Above Average depending on AI difficulty and implementation.

## Comments
 - Hmmm...I'm pretty sure min-max algorithms require knowledge of a full tree, or a heuristic. In this case you'd need a good solid heuristic. You probably can find one online for that.
 - The range of difficulty depends a lot on how much you implement yourselves since there isn't a whole lot of complexity involved besides the game decision tree. That and whether its a polished game.
