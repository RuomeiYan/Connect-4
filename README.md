# Connect-4-board-game-school-project
This is a shool project for the course SE 101. We worked in a team of three: Haoyang Qi, Thomas Sun, and Ruomei Yan. We wrote a C program that can play board game Connect 4 with users.

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 

There are 4 modes in our program: Easy, Hard, Hell Mode(not shown the board) and 2-player mode.

In order to enhance the fun part of this game and intenseness of the competition, minimax algorithm is included to help the program make a better decision. What the algorithm does is to recursively evaluate every move that the program possibly makes and then make the best choice.
